This project is a console-based banking application designed to simulate basic banking operations. Users can create an account and perform various transactions such as checking their balance, making deposits, and withdrawals. Additionally, the application allows users to view their most recent transaction and calculate interest on their balance over a specified number of years. The application employs object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating the functionalities within the Account class. It provides a user-friendly interface through a dynamic menu system, enabling users to interact with their account seamlessly.


The menu provides the following options:

A. Check your balance: Allows users to view their current account balance.

B. Make a deposit: Enables users to deposit a specified amount into their account.

C. Make a withdrawal: Allows users to withdraw a specified amount from their account.

D. View previous transaction: Displays the most recent transaction, either deposit or withdrawal.

E. Calculate interest: Calculates and displays the future balance based on the current balance, a fixed interest rate, and a user-specified number of years.

F. Exit: Exits the application.


This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding the principles of Java programming and object-oriented design, providing practical experience in creating interactive console applications.
